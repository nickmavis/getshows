Script: shows.py
By: Nicholas Mavis

Pythong script that pulls all EDM shows from major venues in the DC/MD area. It will them print them via console with the following data:

- Headliner
- Openers
- Date
- Doors

Plans to add cost and see if tickets are sold out are possible. Still currently in development.
